                        <p>
                            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In
                            humans,
                            several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold
                            to more
                            severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                            Syndrome
                            (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

                            COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This
                            new virus and
                            disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

                        <p>
                            The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may
                            have aches and
                            pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually
                            mild and begin
                            gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
                            Most people
                            (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
                            every 6 people who
                            gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and
                            those with
                            underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more
                            likely to
                            develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
                            medical attention.

                        <h4>How does COVID-19 spread?</h4>
                        <p>
                            People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person
                            to person
                            through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                            coughs or
                            exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then
                            catch COVID-19
                            by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can
                            also catch
                            COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales
                            droplets. This
                            is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
                            WHO is assessing
                            ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.

                            The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have
                            symptoms of the
                            disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most
                            commonly around
                            five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available. 11

                            and water are available as there is a higher risk of hand irritation and ill health effects
                            from making
                            and diluting chlorine solutions. Further chlorine solutions must be made daily, stored in a

                            with a lid away from sunlight, otherwise they have the potential to lose potency and
                            efficacy at
                            disinfection. Chlorine is effective as a decontamination (at 0.5%) for environmental
                            cleaning when
                            preceded by cleaning with soap and water.

                            COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary

                        <p>
                            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people
                            get infected
                            with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was
                            associated with civet
                            cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19
                            have not yet
                            been confirmed. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct
                            contact with
                            animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all
                            times. Handle raw
                            meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid
                            consuming raw or
                            undercooked animal products.

                        <h4>Should I wear a mask to protect myself?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking
                            after someone who
                            may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking
                            after someone
                            who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO
                            urges people to
                            use masks wisely. WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of
                            precious
                            resources and mis-use of masks (see Advice on the use of masks). The most effective ways to
                            protect
                            yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough
                            with the bend of
                            elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are
                            coughing or
                            sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information.

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly by close contact with an infected
                            person
                            through respiratory droplets. Whether a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can transmit the virus
                            that causes
                            COVID-19 to her fetus or neonate by other routes of vertical transmission (before, during,
                            or after
                            delivery) is still unknown. However, in limited recent case series of infants born to
                            mothers with
                            COVID-19 published in the peer-reviewed literature, none of the infants have tested positive
                            for the virus
                            that causes COVID-19. Additionally, virus was not detected in samples of amniotic fluid or
                            breastmilk.
                            Limited information is available about vertical transmission for other coronaviruses
                            (MERS-CoV and
                            SARS-CoV) but vertical transmission has not been reported for these infections.

                            No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute

                            different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no

                        <p>
                            Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat
                            COVID-2019.
                            However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness
                            should be
                            hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some
                            specific drug
                            treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is
                            coordinating
                            efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective

                        <p>
                            The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is
                            coughing. The
                            risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
                            people with
                            COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the
                            disease. It
                            is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough
                            and does not
                            feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and
                            will continue to
                            share updated findings.
